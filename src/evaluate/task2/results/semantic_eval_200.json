Pg 156Explanation:Kawasaki disease is associated with hydrops of gallbladder.Gallbladder Wall Thickening A gallbladder wall that is thickened is a sign of inflammation. This is a non-specific finding, and many other pathologic processes, as well as a postprandial gallbladder, can give you falsely elevated measurements.It is important to measure the wall of the anterior gallbladder surface because of the acoustic enhancement artifact mentioned.Because sound waves travel through a fluid-filled structure, no attenuation occurs. Thus, when those sound weaves hit the back of the gallbladder, they will be so strong that they will obscure an accurate picture of the wall thickness.For gallbladder wall thickness, greater than 3 mm is abnormal.Differential for Thickened Gallbladder WallPostprandialRenal failureAscitesHepatitisHypoalbuminemiaHIV/AIDSAdenomyomatosisMultiple myelomaCholecystitisCongestive heart failure",

      "question": "An ill 16 days old baby girl is brought to the emergency. On examination pallor and dyspnoea present with a respiratory rate of 85 per minute. Her HR is 200 bpm, hea sounds are distant and a gallop is heard. X-ray showed cardiomegaly. An echocardiogram shows dilated ventricles and dilation of the left atrium. An ECG shows ventricular depolarization complexes that have low voltage. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. CHF | B. Glycogen storage disease | C. Pericarditis | D. Aberrant left coronary aery arising from pulmonary aery",
      "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is **A. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure)**.\n\nThe baby's symptoms of pallor, dyspnea, and a very high respiratory rate (85 per minute) are indicative of respiratory distress, which can be a sign of heart failure [0, 1, 2]. The elevated heart rate (200 bpm) can be a compensatory mechanism for the heart to maintain cardiac output when it is not functioning efficiently [8]. The distant heart sounds and the presence of a gallop rhythm suggest cardiac dysfunction [5]. Furthermore, the X-ray showing cardiomegaly and the echocardiogram revealing dilated ventricles and left atrium are direct indicators of cardiac pathology, consistent with heart failure [4, 0]. Low voltage complexes on an ECG can be seen in various conditions, but in the context of cardiomegaly and other signs of heart failure, it can suggest a weakened myocardium [10].\n\nWhile other options might present with some overlapping symptoms, CHF best explains the constellation of findings:\n*   **Glycogen storage disease (B)** can affect the heart, but the primary presentation here is acute cardiac decompensation, and the provided references do not specifically link it to these findings.\n*   **Pericarditis (C)** can cause distant heart sounds and dyspnea, but cardiomegaly and dilated ventricles are not typical primary findings, and ECG changes in pericarditis often include diffuse ST elevation, which is not mentioned [11].\n*   **Aberrant left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery (D)** is a possibility for severe heart failure in infants, but the provided references do not offer specific information to favor this diagnosis over CHF based on the given data.\n\nThe references indicate that HF patients are related to HF [0, 2], and HF can be related to dilated cardiomyopathy [4]. Hypertension can also cause heart failure [30, 38, 39, 113, 126].",

With glycogen storage disease of the hea muscle thickening would be expected. With pericarditis- pericardial effusion is seen. On ECG, the voltages of the ventricular complexes seen with aberrant origin of the left coronary aery are not diminished, and a pattern of myocardial infarction can be seen. *",

      "ground_truth": "Can be diagnosed intrauterine || Ans. A. Can be diagnosed intrauterineExplanationClinical features of ARPKD (Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease) are:Classic ARPKD is generally diagnosed in utero or within the neonatal period and characterized by greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys in diseased fetuses. (Option a)Reduced fetal urine production may contribute to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia.About 30% of affected neonates die shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency. Close to 60% of mortality occurs within the first month of life.In the classic group, most patients are bom with renal insufficiency and ESRD (End stage renal disease). (Option b)However, infants often have a transient improvement in their GFR; death from renal insufficiency at this stage is rare.Some patients are diagnosed after the neonatal stage and form the older group. Morbidity and mortality in this group often involve systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and liver manifestations.The hallmarks of ARPKD liver disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a primary ductal plate malformation with associated periportal fibrosis, namely congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli's disease). CHF and Caroli's disease can then lead to portal hypertension exhibiting hepatosplenomegaly, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis.Some patients with the diagnosis of ARPKD at 1 year of age with nephromegaly exhibit slowly declining renal function over 20 years with only minimally enlarged kidneys at ESRD (Option c and e) and markedly atrophic kidneys following renal transplantation.The slow progression of renal disease is likely due to increasing fibrosis rather than the development of cysts.Systemic hypertension is common in all ARPKD patients, even those with normal renal function.

It is about 10% of total activity and is increased in obstructive jaundice and to some extent in metastatic carcinoma of liver.# Alpha-2 heat labile ALP is stable at 56degC; but loses its activity when kept at 65degC for 30 minutes. It is produced by hepatic cells. Therefore, exaggerated alpha-2 band suggests hepatitis. This liver iso-enzyme forms about 25% of total ALP.# Alpha-2 heat stable ALP will not be destroyed at 65degC, but is inhibited by phenylalanine. It is of placental origin, which is found in blood in normal pregnancy. An iso-enzyme closely resembling the placental form is characteristically seen in circulation in about 15% cases of carcinoma of lung, liver and gut and named as Regan iso-enzyme (after the first patient in whom it was detected) or carcinoplacental iso-enzyme. Chronic heavy smoking also increases Regan iso-enzyme level in blood. Normal level is only 1% of the total ALP.# Pre-beta ALP is of bone origin and elevated levels are seen in bone diseases. This is most heat labile (destroyed at 56degC, 10 min). Wheat germ lectin will precipitate bone isoenzyme. This constitutes about 50% of normal ALP activity.# Gamma-ALP is inhibited by phenylalanine and originates from intestinal cells. It is increased in ulcerative colitis.

      "ground_truth": "Etomidate || Ans. is 'b' i.e., Etomidate Effects of Etomidate on cardiovascular systemEtomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system.It causes mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance which may cause a slight decline in arterial blood pressure.Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol:The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in arterial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload).Propofol markedly impairs the normal arterial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload.Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental)The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, bas line autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease.Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure.Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes.However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, b adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and arterial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression.Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular systemKetamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary artery pressure and myocardial work.Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms.",

      "question": "A male patient 56 year old complains of swelling in legs. He is a known case of hypertension and is under treatment. On general physical examination pitting oedema is seen on legs and TSH level 3mU/L. Which of the following is not a cause of this condition? A. Increase in hydrostatic pressure | B. Decreased colloid osmotic pressure | C. Due to lymphatic obstruction | D. Myxedema",
      "answer": "The patient presents with swelling in the legs (pitting edema), a history of hypertension, and a TSH level of 3 mU/L. The question asks to identify what is NOT a cause of this condition. Let's analyze the options:\n\n*   **A. Increase in hydrostatic pressure:** Hypertension is a known cause of increased hydrostatic pressure within blood vessels, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces, causing edema [1][55]. The patient's history of hypertension supports this as a potential cause.\n\n*   **B. Decreased colloid osmotic pressure:** This can occur in conditions leading to low serum protein levels, such as liver or kidney disease, which can also be associated with or exacerbated by hypertension. While not directly stated, it's a plausible mechanism for edema [23].\n\n*   **C. Due to lymphatic obstruction:** Lymphatic obstruction prevents the proper drainage of interstitial fluid, leading to lymphedema, which can manifest as leg swelling. This is a recognized cause of edema.\n\n*   **D. Myxedema:** Myxedema is a severe form of hypothyroidism. The patient's TSH level of 3 mU/L is generally considered within the normal range (typically 0.4-4.0 mU/L) and does not indicate hypothyroidism or myxedema [87]. Therefore, myxedema is the least likely cause of the patient's leg swelling based on the provided TSH level.\n\nConsidering the information, myxedema is the least likely cause.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
      "ground_truth": "Myxedema || Most leg swelling is caused by oedema, the accumulation of ﬂuid within the interstitial space. Unilateral swelling usually indicates a localised pathology in either the venous or the lymphatic system, while bilateral oedema often represents generalised ﬂuid overload combined with the effects of gravity. However, all causes of unilateral leg swelling may present bilaterally, and generalised ﬂuid overload may present with asymmetrical (and therefore apparently unilateral) oedema. Fluid overload may be the result of cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension (even in the absence of right ventricular failure), renal failure, hypoalbuminaemia or drugs (calcium channel blockers, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and others). <NL> Approximately 60% of lean body weight is water, two-thirds of which is intracellular. Most of the remaining water is found in extracellular compartments in the form of interstitial fluid; only 5% of the body’s water is in blood plasma. As noted earlier, edema is an accumulation of interstitial fluid within tissues. <NL> <NL> Increase in hydrostatic pressure are mainly caused by disorders that impair venous return. Local increases in intravascular pressure caused, for example, by deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity can cause edema restricted to the distal portion of the affected leg. <NL> Reduction of plasma albumin concentrations leads to decreased colloidal osmotic pressure of the blood and loss of fluid from the circulation. <NL> Edema may result from lymphatic obstruction that compromises resorption of fluid from interstitial spaces. <NL> <NL> <NL> Reference:Davidson’s Internal Medicine 23rd edition, page no.186",

Given the history of parathyroid surgery, a recurrent parathyroid adenoma or metastatic disease is a strong possibility.\n\nOption B, treatment with technetium-99m sestamibi scan, is a diagnostic imaging technique used to locate parathyroid adenomas, particularly in cases of recurrence or ectopic glands [0, 8]. This would help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are less appropriate as initial steps. Repeat neck surgery (A) might be considered later if the mass is confirmed to be a parathyroid adenoma and is surgically accessible. Observation and repeat serum calcium (C) might be suitable for asymptomatic, small lesions, but the presence of a palpable mass and elevated calcium suggests a more active process. Ultrasound-guided alcohol injection (D) is a less common treatment for parathyroid adenomas and is typically reserved for specific situations or when surgery is not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate initial management is to confirm the diagnosis with appropriate imaging.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",

      "question": "A 9-year-old girl is diagnosed with acute rheumatic fever. Instead of recovering as expected, her condition worsens and she dies. Which of the following is the most likely cause of death? A. Central nervous system involvement | B. Endocarditis | C. Myocarditis | D. Streptococcal sepsis",
      "answer": "The most likely cause of death for a 9-year-old girl diagnosed with acute rheumatic fever, whose condition worsens and leads to death, is **C. Myocarditis**.\n\nAcute rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can affect the heart, leading to complications such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and endocarditis (inflammation of the heart lining and valves). Myocarditis can cause severe cardiac dysfunction, heart failure, and arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening, especially in children [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194]. While endocarditis is also a common manifestation, myocarditis can lead to a more rapid and severe decline in cardiac function, potentially resulting in death [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194].

      "answer": "Mitochondrial inheritance is a pattern of inheritance in which traits are passed down from the mother to her offspring. This is because mitochondria, the organelles responsible for cellular respiration, are primarily inherited from the egg cell during fertilization. Therefore, if a female is affected by a condition caused by mitochondrial DNA, all of her offspring will inherit the affected mitochondria and thus the condition. Conversely, if a male is affected, he cannot pass on the condition to his offspring because the mitochondria in his sperm do not contribute to the offspring's mitochondria.\n\nBased on this, the correct answer is:\n\nB.

      "answer": "The most probable diagnosis for a 6-month-old baby presenting with features of cardiac failure, developmental delay, a large tongue, and severe concentric LVH on echocardiography is **A. Pompe disease**.\n\nPompe disease, also known as Glycogen Storage Disease Type II, is a lysosomal storage disorder that can affect the heart, leading to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure in infants. Developmental delay and a large tongue are also recognized clinical manifestations of infantile Pompe disease. The provided references indicate that \"HF PATIENTS\" are related to \"HEART FAILURE\" [2], and \"HYPERTENSION\" can cause \"CARDIAC ETIOLOGIES\" [30] and \"HEART FAILURES\" [5]. While the references do not directly mention Pompe disease, the clinical presentation aligns with a condition that severely impacts cardiac function, leading to heart failure.",
      "ground_truth": "Pompe disease || The type of glycogen storage disease that primarily involves the hea is Pompe disease (GSD IIa) in which acid maltase, necessary for hydrolysis of the outer branches of glycogen, is absent. There is marked deposition of glycogen within the myocardium. Affected infants are well at bih, but symptoms of growth and developmental delay, feeding problems, and cardiac failure occur by the sixth month of life. Physical examination reveals generalized muscular weakness, a large tongue, and cardiomegaly without significant hea murmurs. Chest radiographs reveal cardiomegaly with or without pulmonary venous congestion. The ECG shows a sho PR interval and LVH with ST depression and T-wave inversion over the left precordial leads. Echocardiography shows severe concentric LVH. Children with Pompe disease usually die before age 1 year. Death may be sudden or result from progressive HF.

      "question": "An epidemiologic study observes increased numbers of respiratory tract infections among children living in a community in which most families are at the poverty level. The infectious agents include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most of the children have had pneumonitis and rubeola infection. The study documents increased rates of keratomalacia, urinary tract calculi, and generalized papular dermatosis in these children as they reach adulthood. These children are most likely to have a deficiency of which of the following vitamins? A. Vitamin A | B. Vitamin B1 | C. Vitamin E | D. Vitamin D",
      "answer": "The children are most likely to have a deficiency of Vitamin A.\n\nVitamin A is essential for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues, including those lining the respiratory tract, which helps protect against infections [0]. A deficiency in Vitamin A can impair the immune system's ability to fight off pathogens, leading to an increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections like pneumonitis [0]. Furthermore, Vitamin A deficiency is a known cause of keratomalacia, a severe eye condition characterized by corneal softening and ulceration, which can lead to blindness [0]. Vitamin A also plays a role in skin health, and deficiency can manifest as various dermatological issues, including papular eruptions [0]. The combination of recurrent respiratory infections, eye pathology, and skin abnormalities strongly suggests a Vitamin A deficiency.",
      "ground_truth": "Vitamin A || Vitamin A is important in maintaining epithelial surfaces. Deficiency of this vitamin can lead to squamous metaplasia of respiratory epithelium, predisposing to infection. Increased keratin buildup leads to follicular plugging and papular dermatosis. Desquamated keratinaceous debris in the urinary tract forms the nidus for stones. Ocular complications of vitamin A deficiency include xerophthalmia and corneal scarring, which can lead to blindness. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency causes problems such as Wernicke disease, neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy. Vitamin D deficiency in children causes rickets, characterized by bone deformities. Vitamin E deficiency occurs rarely; it causes neurologic symptoms related to degeneration of the axons in the posterior columns of the spinal cord. Vitamin K deficiency can result in a bleeding diathesis.",

      "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is **A. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n*   **Acute Pancreatitis as a Trigger:** Acute pancreatitis is a known cause of ARDS [0]. The systemic inflammatory response triggered by pancreatitis can lead to lung injury.\n*   **Sudden Onset Breathlessness:** This is a primary symptom of ARDS.\n*   **Bilateral Infiltrates on Chest X-ray:** This finding is characteristic of the diffuse alveolar damage seen in ARDS.\n*   **Low CVP (< 18 mmHg):** A low central venous pressure (CVP) suggests the absence of fluid overload, making congestive left heart failure less likely [0]. Congestive heart failure typically presents with elevated CVP due to fluid backup.\n*   **Exclusion of Other Options:**\n    *   **B. Myocardial Infarction (MI):** While MI can cause breathlessness, bilateral infiltrates and a low CVP are not typical findings for an uncomplicated MI.\n    *   **C. Congestive Left Heart Failure (CHF):** The low CVP makes CHF less probable, as CHF is usually associated with fluid overload and higher CVP.\n    *   **D. Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** PE can cause sudden breathlessness, but bilateral infiltrates are not the primary radiographic finding. While PE can lead to ARDS, ARDS is a more direct consequence of severe pancreatitis in this scenario.",

      "answer": "Pulmonary edema generally begins to appear when left atrial pressure approaches 15 mm Hg [1].",
      "ground_truth": "20 mm Hg || Pulmonary edema is one of the most serious consequences of left ventricular cardiac failure. When the left ventricle fails or when the mitral valve fails, left atrial pressure (LAP) may increase substantially. The resulting increase in pulmonary capillary pressure (Pc) forces excess fluid filtration through the pulmonary capillary walls and into the lung tissue. At first, the fluid collects within the lung interstitial space. If LAP exceeds a critical level of ~25 mmHg, the volume of edema fluid will overwhelm the capacity of the interstitial spaces and fluid will flood the airways and alveoli (8). This airway edema directly interferes with gas exchange, and it can kill the patient. However, many people live for months or years with modestly elevated LAP (<25 mmHg). We believe that sustained, subcritical LAP elevations lead to two phases of change in the lungs. The first phase is the acute edema that develops in the first few hours of elevated LAP. The second phase concerns the effect of long-term (7 days or more) increases in LAP below the critical level. This review deals with the acute phase and long-term phase changes in the lung caused by modestly elevated LAP. The acute phase of pulmonary edema has been the subject of intense investigation for many years. In 1896, Starling (7) laid the foundation for our current understanding of pulmonary edema with his famous fluid filtration equation. The equation relates the rate of fluid filtration through the capillary wall (Jv) to the pressures across the capillary wall and to the filtration characteristics of the capillary membrane Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition",

      "answer": "The diagnosis for a 26-year-old man who died while playing and had myocyte hypertrophy in his autopsy is most likely **A. HOCM (Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy)**.\n\nMyocyte hypertrophy, the enlargement of heart muscle cells, is a characteristic feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. HOCM involves thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the left ventricle, which can lead to obstruction of blood flow during exertion [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Sudden death during physical activity is a known, albeit tragic, presentation of HOCM, especially in younger individuals [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by enlarged and weakened heart chambers, not primarily myocyte hypertrophy [4]. Arrhythmogenic cardiac problems are a broad category, and HOCM is a specific structural abnormality that can cause arrhythmias and sudden death [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Restrictive cardiomyopathy involves stiffening of the heart muscle, and myocyte hypertrophy is not its primary characteristic [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\n\nThe provided references mention \"HYPERTENSION\" and its relation to \"CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH\" and \"BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT\" [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57], which are relevant to cardiac conditions, but do not directly link these to myocyte hypertrophy as the primary cause of sudden death in a young person during exertion.

Na+, K+- ATPase the elimination 11 /2 for digoxin is 36 hours in patients with nonnal renal function. Digoxin is excreted by the kidney with a clearance rate that is proportional to the glomerular filtration rate. It is now recommended that digoxin be reserved for patients with heart failure who are in atrial fibrillation, or for patients in sinus rhythm who remain symptomatic despite maximal therapy with ACE inhibitors and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists. Although the drug has no net effect on mortality, it reduces hospitalization and death, from progressive heart failure at the expense of an increase in sudden death.Other than heart failure digitalis is useful in the management of atrial arrhythmias because of its cardioselective parasympathomimetic effects. In atrial flutter and fibrillation, the depressant effect of the drug on atrioventricular conduction will help control an excessively high ventricular rate. Digitalis has also been used in the control of paroxysmal atrial and atrioventricular nodal tachycardia.ToxicityExtracardiacAnorexia, nausea, vomiting are usually first symptoms of toxicity. Other complaints include fatigue, malaise, headache, mental confusion, restlessness, disorientation, psychosis and visual disturbances.CardiacAlmost every type of arrhythmia can be produced by digitalis: pulsus bigeminis, nodal and ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Partial to complete A-V block, severe bradycardia.Atrial extra systoles, AF or atrial flutter have also been noted.Treatmenta) For tachyarrythmias:KC1 infusion 20 m mol /hr IV or give orally in mild cases.b) For ventricular arrythmias: Lidocaine IV repeated as required is the drug of choice.c) For supraventricular arrythmias: Propranolol may be given IV or oral depending on urgencyd) For A-V block and bradycardia: Atropine 0.6-1.2 mg IM may help: otherwise cardiac pacing is recommended.Therapy of toxicity manifested as visual changes or gastrointestinal disturbances generally requires no more than reducing the dose of the drug.Immunotherapy with purified Fab fragments from bovine antidigoxin antisera (DIGIBIND) provides an effective antidote for lifethreatening digoxin toxicity.Precautions and contraindicationsHypokalaemia:enhances digitalis toxicityby increasing its binding to Na+ K+ATPase elderly, renal or severe hepatic disease Myocardial infarction: sever arrythmias are more likely thyrotoxicosis-reduces responsiveness to digitalis.Myxedema: these patienst eliminate digoxin more slowly, toxicity can appearVentricular tachycardia:digitalis is contraindicated, may precipitate ventricular fibrillationIt is explicitly contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation",

Calcium channel blockers** are not typically considered a first-line treatment for acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared to the other options.\n\n*   **Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)** is a thrombolytic agent used to break down blood clots, which is a critical intervention in acute MI [0].\n*   **Intravenous beta-blockers** are used to reduce the heart's workload by decreasing heart rate and blood pressure, which is beneficial during an acute MI [33][164].\n*   **Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin)** is an antiplatelet medication that helps prevent further clot formation, a cornerstone of acute MI management [34].\n\nWhile calcium channel blockers can be used in certain situations related to MI, such as for ongoing ischemia or vasospasm, they are generally not the primary treatment for the acute phase of MI and can even be contraindicated in some cases, particularly with certain types of MI or if there is impaired left ventricular function [163].",
      "ground_truth": "Calcium channel blockers || Ref : harrisons-manual-of-medicine-16th-edition pg no: 622-624 TREATMENT Initial Therapy Initial goals are to: (1) quickly identify if patient is candidate for reperfusion therapy, (2) relieve pain, and (3) prevent/treat arrhythmias and mechanical complications. * Aspirin should be administered immediately (162-325 mg chewed at presentation, then 162-325 mg PO qd), unless pt is aspirin-intolerant. * Perform targeted history, exam, and ECG to identify STEMI (\u00011 mmST elevation in two contiguous leads or new LBBB) and appropriateness of reperfusion therapy , which reduces infarct size, LV dysfunction, and moality. * Primary PCI is generally more effective than fibrinolysis and is preferred at experienced centers capable of performing procedure rapidly , especially when diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic shock is present, bleeding risk is increased, or if symptoms have been present for \u00013 h. * Proceed with IV fibrinolysis if PCI is not available or if logistics would delay PCI \u00011 h longer than fibrinolysis could be initiated (Fig. 123-1). Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mmHg, hea rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

Restrictive cardiomyopathy",

Therefore, based on the given references, it is not possible to answer the question.",
      "ground_truth": "Restrictive cardiomyopathy || Long-standing inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid ahritis (RA) are associated with deposition of a form of amyloid known as AA (amyloid-associated protein), which may involve kidneys, hea, liver, skeletal muscle, and skin, for example. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium results in decreased compliance and impaired diastolic filling, i.e., restrictive cardiomyopathy. The myocardium has a rigid and waxy texture. This form of amyloid, as well as any other biochemical form, can be visualized on tissue section by staining with Congo red, which acquires a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Constrictive pericarditis is due to any pathologic process that results in fibrous thickening of the pericardium, with resultant impaired compliance. Clinically, therefore, this condition manifests with a picture similar to restrictive cardiomyopathy because of impaired diastolic filling. Constrictive pericarditis is usually caused by previous episodes of acute pericarditis, especially hemorrhagic, suppurative, and caseous pericarditis. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by massive ventricular dilatation and may be caused by genetic alterations, myocarditis, toxic insults (alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), etc. Most cases are idiopathic. The main pathophysiologic alteration is impaired contractility. You may be tempted to think that this patient is prone to developing hypersensitivity myocarditis, but this form of myocardial disease has been repoed after treatment with some antihypeensive agents,antibiotics, diuretics and not with coicosteroids or NSAIDs. Fuhermore, myocarditis manifests acutely with arrhythmias and hea failure, and chronically with dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive hea failure. Ref: Hoit B.D. (2011). Chapter 34.

      "answer": "Pulsus paradoxus is a clinical sign that is typically associated with conditions that cause increased intrathoracic pressure, such as severe asthma or emphysema [C, C]. In these conditions, the negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration can lead to a significant drop in systolic blood pressure, which is detected as a decrease in pulse amplitude during inspiration [C].\n\nWhile the provided references do not directly mention \"pulsus paradoxus,\" they do discuss conditions that can lead to respiratory distress and cardiovascular compromise. For example, COPD is linked to shortness of breath, worsening respirations, and respiratory failure [C, C]. These severe respiratory conditions can indeed be associated with pulsus paradoxus.\n\nThe other options are less directly supported by the provided references in relation to pulsus paradoxus:\n*   **Shock:** While shock can cause changes in pulse, the references do not specifically link it to pulsus paradoxus.\n*   **Elderly:** Age is a general factor, but not a direct cause of pulsus paradoxus in the way a specific respiratory condition is.\n*   **High output state:** This is a less common association with pulsus paradoxus compared to obstructive airway diseases.\n\nTherefore, based on the general understanding of pulsus paradoxus and its association with severe respiratory conditions, **Emphysema/Asthma** is the most likely answer.",

However, based on the information, diazoxide is a K+ channel opener, an antihypertensive agent, used for insulinoma, and can cause severe hypoglycemia.",
      "ground_truth": ">Causes severe hypoglycemia || Causes severe hypoglycemia Diazoxide Diazoxide is a direct acting aeriolar dilator. Diazoxide causes aeriolar dilatation with little effect on veins. Diazoxide prevents smooth muscle contraction and relaxes the aerioles Diazoxide is a potassium channel activator which causes local relaxation in smooth muscle by increasing membrane permeability to potassium ions. This switches off voltage gated calcium ion channel which inhibits the generation of action potential. When used as an intravenous antihypeensive agent diazoxide causes excessive hypotension. Diazoxide was formerlyused as an intravenous bolus dose for the at of hypeensive emergencies. But the dangers of excessive hypotension are now recognized to outweigh the benefit, and its emergency use is obsolete. Hypotension due to diazoxide has resulted in stroke and myocardial infarction. - The reflex sympathetic response due to hypotension can provoke angina, electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia and cardiac failure in patients with ischemic hea disease and diazoxide should be avoided in this situation. Diazoxide produces hyperglycemia by increasing insulin secretion, therefore it is used to treat various forms of hypoglycemia Diazoxide activates the same potassium channel in the pancreatic islet cells that is blocked by sulfonylureas. SullOnylureas close the potassium channels and increase insulin secretion whereas diazoxide opens the potassium channel in pancreatic islet cells and decrease insulin secretion. Due to its hyperglycemic action it is a useful drug for patients with chronic hypoglycemia from excess endogenous insulin secretion, either from an iselt cell tumour (insulinoma) or islet cell hyperplasia. According to Lawerence Diazoxide stimulates the ATP dependent r channel that is blocked by the sulphonylureas. Therefore its chronic use as an antihypeensive agent is precluded by the development of diabetes. Indeed its use in therapeutics should now be confined to rare indication of treating hypoglycemia due to islet cell tumour (insulinoma). Diazoxide is chemically related to thiazide diuretics. But in contrast to the structurally related thiazide diuretics, diazoxide causes renal salt and water retention.",

      "answer": "The patient's presentation of a paratracheal mass, history of parathyroid surgery, and hypercalcemia (serum Ca+2 13.0 mg/L) suggests a recurrence or metastasis of the parathyroid adenoma. Given the elevated calcium levels and the presence of a mass, observation alone (Option C) is not the most appropriate management. Repeat neck surgery (Option A) might be considered if the mass is confirmed to be a recurrent adenoma and is surgically accessible. Technetium-99m sestamibi scans (Option B) are diagnostic, not therapeutic.

      "ground_truth": "Productive cough || Ans. is 'd' i.e., Productive cough Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug and thus blocks potassium channel. It acts by increasing the action potential duration and effective refractory period.In spite of its present classification as class 3 drug, amiodarone also significantly blocks inactivated sodium channels. It also has weak adrenergic and calcium channel blocking actions.Consequence of these actions include slowing of the heart rate and AV node conduction.Amiodarone is the most powerful antiarrhythmic drug available for the treatment and prevention of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.Adverse effect:-Even short term use of Amiodarone causes serious toxicity.Amiodarone accumulates in many tissues which includes heart, lung, liver and skin.Pulmonary toxicityIt is the most important adverse effect.It is dose related. Fatal pulmonary fibrosis may be observed even in low doses.Patient usually presents with cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. Symptoms usually start with dry cough and dyspnoea. Remember, that patients on amiodarone often have dyspnoea attributable to other problems such as heart failure, so amiodarone lung toxicity is difficult to diagnose.Liver toxicityAbnormal liver function and hepatitis develops during amiodarone therapy. (I have not got any documented evidence of liver cirrhosis).Skin depositsSkin deposits results in photodermatitis and gray blue skin discoloration in sun exposed areas e.g. the malar region.Corneal micro depositsCorneal micro deposits are seen in virtually all patients treated with Amiodarone after few weeks of treatment.Sometimes optic neuritis may develop and progress to blindness.Effect of Amiodarone on ThyroidAmiodarone is a potential source of large amount of inorganic iodine and it also blocks the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3).Thus Amiodarone may result in hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.Thyroid function should be evaluated prior to initiation of treatment and monitored periodically.Cardiac toxicityAmiodarone may produce symptomatic bradycardia and heart block in patients with preexisting sinus or A-V node disease.",

      "answer": "Hypervolemic hyponatremia is a condition characterized by an excess of total body water and sodium, leading to a dilution of sodium in the blood. Several medical conditions can cause hypervolemic hyponatremia. Among the options provided, **hypothyroidism** is not a direct cause of hypervolemic hyponatremia.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Cirrhosis:** Patients with cirrhosis often develop ascites and edema due to portal hypertension and decreased effective circulating volume, leading to increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and water retention, resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia [0].\n*   **Chronic Renal Failure:** In chronic renal failure, the kidneys' ability to excrete free water is impaired. This can lead to fluid overload and dilutional hyponatremia, which is often hypervolemic [96].\n*   **Nephrotic Syndrome:** In nephrotic syndrome, the loss of protein in the urine leads to hypoalbuminemia and decreased plasma oncotic pressure. This can cause fluid to shift into the interstitial space, leading to a decrease in effective circulating volume, which in turn stimulates ADH release and water retention, resulting in hypervolemic hyponatremia [116].\n\n**Hypothyroidism**, while it can affect fluid balance and electrolyte levels, is not typically classified as a primary cause of hypervolemic hyponatremia. In fact, hypothyroidism can sometimes be associated with *hypo*volemic hyponatremia due to impaired renal concentrating ability and increased free water excretion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **A.

      "answer": "The management of a patient post myocardial infarction who developed atrial fibrillation and subsequently has a mural thrombus shown on ECHO is **A. Warfarin**.\n\nWarfarin is an anticoagulant used to prevent blood clots. In patients with atrial fibrillation and a mural thrombus, anticoagulation is crucial to reduce the risk of embolic events, such as stroke [36]. The presence of a mural thrombus in this context indicates a significant risk of clot formation that could dislodge and travel to the brain [36]. Therefore, anticoagulation with warfarin is the standard of care to mitigate this risk.\n\nThe other options are less appropriate as the primary management:\n*   **B. Cardioversion:** While cardioversion is used to restore normal heart rhythm in atrial fibrillation, it does not directly address the mural thrombus and can increase the risk of embolization if a thrombus is present.\n*   **C. Digoxin:** Digoxin is used to control heart rate in atrial fibrillation but does not prevent clot formation or manage the mural thrombus.\n*   **D.

Hypovolemia, Rhabdomyolysis, and Snake bite are all recognized causes of acute renal failure [1, 2, 3].\n\n*   **Hypovolemia:** This refers to a decrease in blood volume, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the kidneys, causing acute kidney injury [1].\n*   **Rhabdomyolysis:** This is the breakdown of muscle tissue, releasing myoglobin and other substances into the bloodstream that can damage the kidneys [2].\n*   **Snake bite:** Certain snake venoms can be nephrotoxic, directly damaging kidney cells or causing systemic effects that lead to acute renal failure [3].\n*   **Pyelonephritis:** This is an infection of the kidney, which can lead to inflammation and damage, potentially causing acute renal failure. However, in the context of the question asking for an exception, and given that the other options are direct causes of pre-renal or intrinsic renal failure, pyelonephritis is a cause of acute kidney injury, but the question implies a distinction.\n\nTherefore, based on the common understanding of acute renal failure causes, pyelonephritis is the exception if the question is looking for a condition that is not *always* a direct cause or if there's a specific context implied by the references that is not apparent. However, without specific information from the provided references that excludes pyelonephritis as a cause of acute renal failure, and given that it can indeed lead to it, this answer is based on general medical knowledge.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Hypovolemia can lead to acute renal failure.\n[2] Rhabdomyolysis can cause acute renal failure.\n[3] Snake bites can cause acute renal failure.",

Aortic valve balloon dilatation to prevent further worsening | D. Coronary angiography",
      "answer": "The best management for this patient is **B. Aortic valve replacement**.\n\nA 50-year-old man with aortic stenosis and symptoms of fatigue during exercise, coupled with a peak systolic gradient of 60 mmHg at rest, indicates a significant degree of aortic stenosis that warrants intervention [33, 55]. Aortic valve replacement is the gold standard treatment for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis [33]. Medical management alone does not address the underlying mechanical obstruction of the aortic valve [33]. Aortic valve balloon dilatation is generally considered a palliative measure with a high rate of restenosis and is less effective than surgical replacement in the long term for symptomatic patients [33]. Coronary angiography is used to assess for coronary artery disease and is not the primary treatment for aortic stenosis itself, although it may be considered in conjunction with other evaluations [33].",

      "question": "A 63-year-old man who has been previously healthy is admitted to the hospital with a 2-day history of cough, rigors, fever, and right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Chest x-ray shows consolidation of the right lower lobe (RLL) and a free-flowing right pleural effusion. Thoracentesis is performed, and the pleural fluid has the following characteristics:Cell count=1110/mm3Glucose=75 mg/dL (serum glucose=85 mg/dL)Protein=4.0 g/dL (serum protein=7.0 g/dL)LDH=400 U/Lserum LDH=200 U/L, normal=100-200 U/LpH=7.35What is the pathogenesis of the pleural effusion? A. Increase in hydrostatic pressure | B. Decrease in oncotic pressure | C. Increased permeability of visceral pleural membrane capillaries | D. Bacterial infection in the pleural space",
      "answer": "The pathogenesis of the pleural effusion in this patient is most likely due to **D. Bacterial infection in the pleural space**.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of cough, rigors, fever, and pleuritic chest pain, along with the chest X-ray findings of right lower lobe consolidation and a pleural effusion, are highly suggestive of pneumonia. The pleural fluid analysis further supports an inflammatory process, indicated by the elevated cell count (1110/mm³). The elevated protein (4.0 g/dL) and LDH (400 U/L) levels, particularly the LDH being twice the upper limit of normal serum LDH, are consistent with an exudative effusion, which is commonly caused by inflammation and infection extending into the pleural space [1]. This type of effusion is known as a parapneumonic effusion and can progress to empyema if not treated.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n*   **A. Increase in hydrostatic pressure:** This typically leads to transudative effusions, often seen in conditions like heart failure, which is not directly indicated by the provided data.\n*   **B. Decrease in oncotic pressure:** This is usually associated with conditions like liver cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome, which are not suggested by the patient's presentation or pleural fluid analysis.\n*   **C. Increased permeability of visceral pleural membrane capillaries:** While increased capillary permeability is a component of exudative effusions, the primary driver in this clinical scenario is the bacterial infection. The increased permeability is a consequence of the inflammatory response to the infection [1].",
      "ground_truth": "Increased permeability of visceral pleural membrane capillaries || Clinical conditions associated with either an increase in hydrostatic pressure (such as congestive heart failure) or a decrease in oncotic pressure (such as nephrotic syndrome) are associated with transudative pleural effusions. This patient's pleural fluid is exudative by all three of the Light criteria: pleural fluid/serum protein ratio is greater than 0.5, pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio is greater than 0.6, and pleural fluid LDH is greater than two-thirds the upper limits of the normal serum LDH. The most likely explanation for an exudative pleural effusion in the setting of an acute pneumonia is a parapneumonic effusion. Parapneumonic effusions occur in about 40% of patients with bacterial pneumonia. Parapneumonic effusions are exudative due to the fact that there is increased permeability of the visceral pleural membrane capillaries, and interstitial fluid moves across the visceral pleura into the pleural space. Parapneumonic effusions may be simple or complicated. Simple parapneumonic effusions are sterile and free flowing. If bacteria invade the pleural space, neutrophils move into the pleural space and anaerobic metabolism of glucose results in a low pleural fluid pH (<7.20) and glucose (<60). The characteristics of this patient's pleural fluid suggest that bacterial invasion of the pleural space has not occurred, and that this is a simple parapneumonic effusion. Hemorrhage into the pleural space occurs with trauma, cancer, and pulmonary embolism, but rarely with pneumonia.",

      "answer": "A drug with a high volume of distribution is generally lipophilic. Lipophilic drugs can readily cross cell membranes and distribute into various tissues and organs, leading to a larger apparent volume of distribution. Hydrophilic drugs, on the other hand, tend to remain in the bloodstream and extracellular fluid, resulting in a smaller volume of distribution. Highly protein-bound drugs also tend to have a more restricted distribution, as a significant portion of the drug is sequestered in the plasma.

The volume of distribution of drugs extensively bound to plasma proteins but not to tissue components approaches plasma volume; warfarin is an example. By contrast, for drugs highly bound to tissues, the volume of distribution can be far greater than any physiologic space. For example, the volume of distribution of digoxin and tricyclic antidepressants is hundreds of liters, obviously exceeding total-body volume. Such drugs are not readily removed by dialysis, an important consideration in overdose.Only when distribution is near-complete does the concentration of digoxin in plasma reflect pharmacologic effect. For this reason, there should be a 6-8 h wait after administration before plasma levels of digoxin are measured as a guide to therapy.Educational pointsClinical Implications of Altered Protein BindingThe acute-phase reactant ?l-acid glycoprotein binds to basic drugs, such as lidocaine or quinidine, and is increased in a range of common conditions, including myocardial infarction, surgery, neoplastic disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and burns. This increased binding can lead to reduced pharmacologic effects at therapeutic concentrations of total drug. Conversely, conditions such as hypoalbuminemia, liver disease, and renal disease can decrease the extent of drug binding, particularly of acidic and neutral drugs, such as phenytoin. Here, plasma concentration of free drug is increased, so drug efficacy and toxicity are enhanced if total (free + bound) drug concentration is used to monitor therapy.",

COMED K 2007) A. Poor antibiotic coverage | B. Rough handling during surgery | C. Removal of parathyroid | D. Inadequate preoperative preparation",
      "answer": "The most likely cause of thyroid storm in a patient who underwent thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism is **D. Inadequate preoperative preparation**.\n\nThyroid storm is a severe and life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism. It can be triggered by various stressors, including surgery [1]. Inadequate preoperative preparation implies that the patient's hyperthyroid state was not sufficiently controlled before the thyroidectomy. This lack of control can make the patient more vulnerable to developing thyroid storm when subjected to the stress of surgery [1].\n\nThe provided references do not directly link poor antibiotic coverage, rough handling during surgery, or parathyroid removal to the development of thyroid storm in this specific context. While infection can precipitate thyroid storm, there's no information in the references to suggest poor antibiotic coverage as the primary cause here. Similarly, surgical trauma is a stressor, but inadequate preoperative preparation is a more direct and common trigger for thyroid storm in the context of surgery for hyperthyroidism. Removal of parathyroid glands leads to hypocalcemia, which has different clinical manifestations than thyroid storm.",

Constrictive pericarditis | C. Restrictive cardiomyopathy | D. Acute cor-pulmonale",
      "answer": "The clinical diagnosis is **B. Constrictive pericarditis**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n*   **Low QRS voltage on ECG:** This is a classic finding in constrictive pericarditis, indicating reduced electrical activity reaching the body surface due to thickened or calcified pericardium [0].\n*   **Small heart with calcification on lateral view (Chest X-ray):** Pericardial calcification is a hallmark of chronic constrictive pericarditis, and the small heart size can be due to the restrictive nature of the pericardium [0].\n*   **Ascites and exceptional fatigue:** These are symptoms of right-sided heart failure, which can be caused by the impaired filling of the ventricles due to the constricting pericardium [10].\n*   **Rapid, irregular pulse rate:** While atrial fibrillation can occur in various cardiac conditions, it is frequently seen in constrictive pericarditis due to atrial stretch and increased filling pressures [35].\n\nLet's consider why the other options are less likely:\n\n*   **A. Rheumatic pan-carditis:** While rheumatic fever can cause inflammation of all layers of the heart, it typically leads to valvular disease and often a larger, dilated heart, not necessarily calcification and low voltage [4].\n*   **C. Restrictive cardiomyopathy:** This condition involves stiffening of the heart muscle itself, leading to impaired filling. While it shares some symptoms with constrictive pericarditis (fatigue, ascites), the ECG findings of low QRS voltage and the presence of pericardial calcification on X-ray are more specific to constrictive pericarditis [4].\n*   **D. Acute cor-pulmonale:** This refers to acute right heart strain, usually due to a sudden increase in pulmonary artery pressure (e.g., from a pulmonary embolism or COPD exacerbation) [10]. While it can cause fatigue and ascites, the ECG findings (low QRS voltage) and the presence of calcification are not typical of acute cor-pulmonale [0]. The provided data does mention COPD and pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to cor-pulmonale, but the specific ECG and X-ray findings point away from this being the primary diagnosis [0].",

      "question": "All of the following are true about Graves disease except A. Cardiac failure is common | B. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia or thyroid gland is due to TSH- Rab | C. Remissions and exacerbations are not infrequent | D. It is highly vascular with audible bruit",
      "answer": "The statement that is **not true** about Graves' disease is:\n\n**B. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the thyroid gland is due to TSH-Rab**\n\nGraves' disease is characterized by the presence of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor Antibodies (TSH-R Abs), also known as TRAbs. These antibodies bind to the TSH receptor on thyroid follicular cells and stimulate them, leading to the overproduction of thyroid hormones. This stimulation is the cause of the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the thyroid gland seen in Graves' disease. Therefore, statement B is actually true.\n\nThe provided references do not contain information about Graves' disease. However, based on general medical knowledge:\n\n*   **A. Cardiac failure is common:** Hyperthyroidism, as seen in Graves' disease, can lead to increased heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output, which can precipitate or worsen heart failure, especially in individuals with pre-existing cardiac conditions. This statement is generally true.\n*   **C. Remissions and exacerbations are not infrequent:** Graves' disease can follow a course of remissions and exacerbations, particularly if treated with antithyroid medications. This statement is generally true.\n*   **D. It is highly vascular with audible bruit:** The hypermetabolic state and increased blood flow to the thyroid gland in Graves' disease often result in a highly vascular gland that may have an audible bruit when auscultated. This statement is generally true.\n\nSince statements A, C, and D are generally true about Graves' disease, and statement B is also true (as explained above), there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the provided options. However, if forced to choose an exception based on the provided (though irrelevant) references, and re-evaluating the initial premise, the question asks for the exception. Given that A, C, and D are well-established clinical features of Graves' disease, and B accurately describes the mechanism of thyroid enlargement, there might be an error in the question itself or the expected answer.\n\nHowever, if we strictly interpret the question as asking which statement is *not* true, and assuming there's no error in the question, then the initial reasoning that B is the exception is flawed because B is a true statement about Graves' disease. Without relevant references to evaluate A, C, and D, it's impossible to definitively identify an exception based solely on the provided information.\n\nGiven the constraints and the provided references which are not relevant to Graves' disease, I cannot definitively answer which statement is the exception based on the references. However, if we consider the typical presentation of Graves' disease, statements A, C, and D are generally considered true. Statement B, as explained, is also a true statement regarding the pathophysiology. There might be a nuance or specific context missing from the question or options.",

COA (Coarctation of the Aorta)**.\n\nThis is because coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta, which restricts blood flow to the lower body. This restriction leads to a pulse deficit, where the femoral pulse is weaker than the radial pulse. The increased workload on the left ventricle due to the aortic narrowing can also result in cardiac failure in infants [0].\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n*   **PDA (Patent Ductus Arteriosus)** typically causes bounding pulses in both upper and lower extremities due to the left-to-right shunt.\n*   **VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect)** can cause cardiac failure but usually does not result in a differential pulse strength between the upper and lower extremities.\n*   **Aorto-illiac vasculitis** is a less common cause of cardiac failure in infants compared to congenital heart defects like coarctation of the aorta.",
      "ground_truth": "COA || Ref: Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics. 19th Edition.Explanation:Weak femoral pulse is indicative of Coarctation of aorta. Normally, the femoral pulse occurs slightly before the radial pulse. Weak femoral pulse or femoral pulse felt after radial pulse is a characteristic feature of COACoarctation of aorta (COA)Constrictions of the aorta of varying degrees may occur at any point from the transverse arch to the iliac bifurcation, hut 98% occur just below the origin of the left subclavian artery at the origin of the ductus arteriosus i juxtaductal coarctation).The anomaly occurs twice as often in males as in females.Coarctation of the aorta may be a feature of Turner syndrome and is associated with a bicuspid aortic valve in more than 70% of patients.Mitral valve abnormalities (a supravalvular mitral ring or parachute mitral valve) and subaortic stenosis are potential associated lesions.When this group of left-sided obstructive lesions occurs together, they are referred to as the Shone complex.Clinical ManifestationsMostly asymptomaticSome children or adolescents complain about weakness or pain in the legs after exerciseSilent hypertension diagnosed on routine physical examination.Disparity in pulsation and blood pressure in the arms and legs.The femoral, popliteal, posterior tibia], and dorsalis pedis pulses are weak (or absent in up to 40%' of patients), in contrast to the bounding pulses of the arms and carotid vessels.The radial and femoral pulses should always be palpated simultaneously for the presence of a radial-femora] delay.Normally, the femoral pulse occurs slightly before the radial pulse. A radial-femoral delay occurs when blood flow to the descending aorta is dependent on collaterals, in which case the femora] pulse is felt after the radial pulse.In normal persons, systolic blood pressure in the legs obtained by the cuff method is 10-20 mm Hg higher than that in the arms.In coarctation of the aorta, blood pressure in the legs is lower than that in the arms.The precordial impulse and heart sounds are usually normal.The presence of a systolic ejection click or thrill in the suprasternal notch suggests a bicuspid aortic valve (present in 709c of cases).A short systolic murmur is often heard along the left sternal border at the 3rd and 4th intercostal spaces.In older patients with well-developed collateral blood flow, systolic or continuous murmurs may be heard over the left and right sides of the chest laterally and posteriorly. (SUZMAN SIGN)In these patients, a palpable thri 11 can occasionally be appreciated in the intercostal spaces on the back.DiagnosisCardiac enlargement and pulmonary congestion are noted in infants with severe coarctation.The enlarged left subclavian artery commonly produces a prominent shadow in the left superior mediastinum.Notching of the inferior border of the ribs from pressure erosion by enlarged collateral vessels is common by late childhood.In most instances, the descending aorta has an area of poststenotic dilatation.",

      "answer": "Sudden death, right-sided heart failure, or cardiovascular collapse can occur when **C. 60% or more of the pulmonary artery is obstructed with emboli**.\n\nWhile the provided references do not explicitly state the percentage of pulmonary artery obstruction that leads to sudden death, they do establish a link between various cardiovascular conditions and their severity. For instance, hypertension is linked to right-sided heart failure [10][11], and severe cardiovascular events can lead to death [57][98][100][121]. The concept of a \"massive\" obstruction, as implied by option C, would logically lead to more severe consequences like cardiovascular collapse or right-sided heart failure compared to a \"small\" obstruction (option A). \"End artery obliteration\" (option D) is typically a chronic process and not directly associated with sudden cardiovascular collapse. Therefore, a significant obstruction, quantified as 60% or more, is the most likely scenario to cause the described acute and severe outcomes.",

      "answer": "A. Marfan's Syndrome",
      "ground_truth": "Marfan's Syndrome || Marfan Syndrome Marfan syndrome is a disorder of connective tissues,manifested principally by changes in the skeleton, eyes,and cardiovascular system. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Approximately 70% to 85% of cases are familial and transmitted by autosomal dominant inheri- tance. The remainder are sporadic and arise from new mutations. Pathogenesis. Marfan syndrome results from an inherited defect in an extracellular glycoprotein called fibrillin 1. There are two fundamental mechanisms by which loss of fibrillin leads to the clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome: loss of structural suppo in microfibril rich connective tissue and excessive activation of TGF-b signaling. Each of these is discussed below. * Fibrillin is the major component of microfibrils found in the extracellular matrix . These fibrils provide a scaffolding on which tropoelastin is deposited to form elastic fibers. Although microfibrils are widely distributed in the body, they are paicularly abundant in the aoa, ligaments, and the ciliary zonules that suppo the lens; these tissues are prominently affected in Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin occurs in two homologous forms, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, encoded by two separate genes, FBN1 and FBN2, mapped on chromo- somes 15q21.1 and 5q23.31, respectively. Mutations of FBN1 underlie Marfan syndrome; mutations of the related FBN2 gene are less common, and they give rise to congenital contractural arachnodactyly, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. Mutational analysis has revealed more than 600 distinct mutations of the FBN1 gene in individuals with Marfan syndrome. Most of these are missense mutations that give rise to abnormal fibrillin-1. These can inhibit polymerization of fibrillin fibers (dominant negative effect). Alternatively, the reduction of fibrillin content below a ceain threshold weakens the connective tissue (haploinsufficiency). * While many clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome can be explained by changes in the mechanical propeies of the extracellular matrix resulting from abnormalities of fibrillin, several others such as bone overgrowth and myxoid changes in mitral valves cannot be attributed to changes in tissue elasticity. Recent studies indicate that loss of microfibrils gives rise to abnormal and excessive activation of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), since normal microfibrils sequester TGF-b and thus control the bioavailability of this cytokine. Excessive TGF-b signaling has deleterious effects on vascular smooth muscle development and it also increases the activity of metalloproteases, causing loss of extracellular matrix. This schema is suppoed by two sets of observations. First, in a small number of individuals with clinical features of Marfan syndrome (MFS2), there are no mutations in FBN1 but instead gain-of-function mutations in genes that encode TGF-b receptors. Second, in mouse models of Marfan syndrome generated by mutations in Fbn1, administrationof antibodies to TGF-b prevents alterations in the aoa and mitral valves. Clinical Features. Although mitral valve lesions are more frequent, they are clinically less impoant than aoic lesions. Loss of connective tissue suppo in the mitral valve leaflets makes them soft and billowy, creating a so-called floppy valve . Valvular lesions, along with lengthening of the chordae tendineae, frequently give rise to mitral regurgitation. Similar changes may affect the tricuspid and, rarely, the aoic valves. Echocardiography greatly enhances the ability to detect the cardiovascular abnormalities and is therefore extremely valuable in the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. The great majority of deaths are caused by rupture of aoic dissections, followed in impoance by cardiac failure. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 145",

      "question": "Wilson disease is due to accumulation of: September 2005 A. Copper | B. Iron | C. Zinc | D. Nickel",
      "answer": "Wilson disease is due to the accumulation of copper [0].",
      "ground_truth": "Copper || Ans. A: Copper In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypeension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body). Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease: Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria. Hea: cardiomyopathy and arrythmias Hormones: hypoparathyroidism, infeility and habitual aboion.",

However, without specific references linking MR directly to sudden death in the provided text, a definitive answer cannot be given based solely on the references.\n\nIf we consider the broader context of cardiovascular conditions that can lead to sudden death, severe valvular heart disease like MR can indeed be a cause.

It is characterized by inflammation of the arterial walls, which can lead to stenosis (narrowing), occlusion (blockage), or aneurysm (dilation) of the affected arteries [0]. The reduced blood flow to the limbs due to arterial narrowing can result in a loss of pulses, hence the term \"pulseless disease\" [0].\n\nGiant cell arteritis is another large-vessel vasculitis, but it typically affects older individuals and commonly involves the temporal arteries [0]. Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness that primarily affects children and is associated with inflammation of the coronary arteries [0].

      "question": "A multi-parous P3L3 young lady who delivered normally 3 weeks ago suddenly developed dyspnea with cardiac failure. She has no H/O cardiac disease before /during pregnancy. She had tachycardia and peripheral edema. Her hemoglobin was 9 gm/dl. Her Echo has revealed an EF of 35%. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Acute MI | B. Deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism | C. Amniotic fluid embolism | D. Peri-paum cardiomyopathy",
      "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is **D. Peripartum cardiomyopathy**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n*   **Sudden onset of dyspnea with cardiac failure:** This indicates an acute cardiac event.\n*   **Young lady, multi-parous (P3L3), delivered normally 3 weeks ago:** This timing is highly suggestive of a peripartum condition. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a form of heart failure that occurs in the last month of pregnancy or the first few months after delivery [0].\n*   **No history of cardiac disease before or during pregnancy:** This rules out pre-existing conditions as the primary cause.\n*   **Tachycardia and peripheral edema:** These are classic signs of heart failure. Peripheral edema is a symptom of heart failure [0].\n*   **Hemoglobin of 9 gm/dl:** While anemia can contribute to dyspnea, it's unlikely to cause acute cardiac failure with an EF of 35% on its own.\n*   **Echo revealing an EF of 35%:** This indicates significant systolic dysfunction, a hallmark of cardiomyopathy. A reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 35% signifies impaired cardiac function [0].\n\nLet's consider why the other options are less likely:\n\n*   **A. Acute MI:** While possible, acute MI in a young, otherwise healthy woman without risk factors is less common than peripartum cardiomyopathy. The timing relative to delivery is also a strong indicator for peripartum issues.\n*   **B. Deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism:** While DVT/PE can cause dyspnea and tachycardia, it typically presents with pleuritic chest pain and may not directly lead to such a profound drop in EF unless it's massive and causes acute right heart strain. The primary issue here is left ventricular dysfunction. Pulmonary embolism is related to hypertension [51].\n*   **C. Amniotic fluid embolism:** Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but catastrophic event that typically occurs during or immediately after delivery. While it can cause cardiovascular collapse, it often presents with a more dramatic and immediate picture involving respiratory distress, coagulopathy, and neurological symptoms. The patient's presentation 3 weeks postpartum makes this less likely.",

Hea failure develops in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months of delivery. 2. Hea pumping function is reduced, with an ejection fraction (EF) less than 45% 3. No other cause for hea failure with reduced EF can be found. In this question anemia, Ml and Pulmonary embolism have been ruled out",

Circulatory failure based on cardiac dysfunction may be caused by primary myocardial failure, most commonly secondary to acute myocardial infarction(MI) , and less frequently by cardiomyopathy or myocarditis , cardiac tamponade, or critical valvular hea disease Systolic and diastolic myocardial dysfunction results in a reduction in cardiac output and often pulmonary congestion. Systemic and coronary hypoperfusion occur, resulting in progressive ischemia. Although a number of compensatory mechanisms are activated in an attempt to suppo the circulation, these compensatory mechanisms may become maladaptive and produce a worsening of hemodynamics. *Release of inflammatory cytokines after myocardial infarction may lead to inducible nitric oxide expression, excess nitric oxide, and inappropriate vasodilation. This causes fuher reduction in systemic and coronary perfusion. A vicious spiral of progressive myocardial dysfunction occurs that ultimately results in death if it is not interrupted.

However, it is generally contraindicated in patients with unstable angina or unstable myocardial infarction due to the risk of precipitating a cardiac event [1, 2].\n\nThe correct answer is **B. To evaluate unstable myocardial infarction**.",
      "ground_truth": "To evaluate unstable angina || Ref: KV Krishna Das - Clinical Medicine 4th Edition pg no:212 Exercise Electrocardiography (Syn: Stress Tests, Treadmill Test) This refers to the recording of the electrical activity of the hea while the individual is subjected to the stress of graded exercises. The bicycle ergometer or the treadmill is currently used for most exercise testing programs. There are various exercise protocols such as the Bruce protocol or the Naughton protocol to assess effo tolerance. In all these protocols the subject is made to exercise in stages of increasing workloads until the end points are achieved. During exercise, various parameters like occurrence of symptoms, fluctuations in blood pressure changes in the ST segment, and changes in cardiac rate and rhythm are closely monitored. Although the stress test is fairly safe, it has to be done only under close medical supervision. Currently the main indications for stress testing are: 1. As a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of symptoms like effo induced chest pain, or palpitation. 2. To assess the prognosis and in the risk stratification of patients with coronary aery disease, either after acute events like myocardial infarction or angina, or after therapeutic interventions like coronary angioplasty or by pass surgery. 3. To assess the functional capacity in patients with ischemic hea disease, valvular hea disease, cardiomyopathy and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 4. As a screening test for ischemic hea disease in subjects with an intermediate or high probability for the disease. The test is considered positive if there is flat or down sloping ST segment depression of 1 mm or more, ST segment elevation, inversion of U waves, fall in blood pressure and ischemic symptoms associated with ECG changes. Standard contraindications to exercise testing include acute myocardial infarction, high risk unstable angina pectoris, severe aoic stenosis, congestive cardiac failure, acute pulmonary embolism or infarction, acute myocarditis or pericarditis, aoic dissection, uncontrolled severe systemic hypeension > 200/100 mm Hg, high grade hea blocks, uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, any acute systemic illness or an unwilling patient. The indications to terminate exercise testing includes inappropriate drop in blood pressure or deceleration of the hea rate with increasing workload and exercise, moderate to severe angina, sustained VT, ST depression more than 3 mm or ST elevation in non Q leads, hypeensive response > 250/115 mm Hg, patient exhaustion, fatigue, leg cramps or claudication pain and subject's desire to stop the test. Exercise stress testing has a sensitivity of about 80 to 85% and a specificity of 85 to 90% for the diagnosis of coronary aery disease. In patients with ischemic hea disease, positive stress test is an indication for fuher tests such as coronary angiography.",

      "question": "A 27 year old man in noted to have blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg. He has prominent aoic ejection click and murmurs heard over the ribs on the both sides anteriorly and over the back posterioly. In addition.the pulses in the lower extremities are feeble and he complains of mild claudication with exeion. The most likely diagnosis is A. Aial septal defect | B. Aoic stenosis | C. Coarctation of the aoa | D. Cardiomyopathy",
      "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is **C. Coarctation of the aorta**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n*   **High Blood Pressure (170/100 mmHg):** The patient presents with significantly elevated blood pressure, which is a key indicator of hypertension [1]. Hypertension is a condition that can be related to various cardiovascular issues [5, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 129, 135, 147, 150, 157, 159, 160, 164, 169, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 181, 183, 186, 187, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194].\n*   **Feeble Pulses in Lower Extremities and Mild Claudication with Exertion:** These symptoms are highly characteristic of coarctation of the aorta. The narrowing of the aorta restricts blood flow to the lower extremities, leading to diminished pulses and pain during physical activity [50, 120, 127].\n*   **Prominent Aortic Ejection Click and Murmurs:** While the references do not directly link these specific findings to coarctation, murmurs and clicks can be indicative of structural heart abnormalities, which can be associated with aortic conditions [32, 33, 34, 55, 165, 166].\n\nConsidering the other options:\n\n*   **A. Atrial Septal Defect (ASD):** While ASDs can cause murmurs, they are not typically associated with such severe hypertension or the specific pattern of diminished lower extremity pulses seen in this patient [10, 11].\n*   **B. Aortic Stenosis:** Aortic stenosis typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur. While it can lead to hypertension, the combination with feeble lower extremity pulses is less characteristic than in coarctation of the aorta [33, 34, 55].\n*   **D. Cardiomyopathy:** Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle. While it can lead to various cardiac issues, the specific constellation of severe hypertension with diminished lower extremity pulses and claudication points more strongly towards a vascular obstruction like coarctation of the aorta [4, 10, 11, 80, 81, 82, 83].",

      "ground_truth": "Early primary coronary intervention || Ref : harrisons-manual-of-medicine-16th-edition pg no: 622-624 TREATMENT Initial Therapy Initial goals are to: (1) quickly identify if patient is candidate for reperfusion therapy, (2) relieve pain, and (3) prevent/treat arrhythmias and mechanical complications. * Aspirin should be administered immediately (162-325 mg chewed at presentation, then 162-325 mg PO qd), unless pt is aspirin-intolerant. * Perform targeted history, exam, and ECG to identify STEMI (\u00011 mmST elevation in two contiguous leads or new LBBB) and appropriateness of reperfusion therapy , which reduces infarct size, LV dysfunction, and moality. * Primary PCI is generally more effective than fibrinolysis and is preferred at experienced centers capable of performing procedure rapidly , especially when diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic shock is present, bleeding risk is increased, or if symptoms have been present for \u00013 h. * Proceed with IV fibrinolysis if PCI is not available or if logistics would delay PCI \u00011 h longer than fibrinolysis could be initiated (Fig. 123-1). Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mmHg, hea rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

      "answer": "Heart failure cells, also known as siderophages, are macrophages that have phagocytosed hemosiderin-laden material. These cells are typically found in the lungs, particularly in the alveoli, when there has been bleeding into the air spaces. This bleeding can occur in conditions associated with pulmonary congestion and edema, which are often consequences of heart failure.\n\nWhile the provided references do not directly mention \"heart failure cells,\" they do establish a strong link between heart failure and lung conditions. For instance, **cor pulmonale** is a condition where the right side of the heart enlargifies due to underlying lung disease [0, 10, 11]. Chronic lung diseases like COPD can lead to pulmonary hypertension, which strains the heart. This strain can result in fluid buildup in the lungs, creating an environment where heart failure cells (siderophages) might be found.\n\nTherefore, based on the understanding of heart failure cells and their association with pulmonary congestion, the most likely location among the options is the **C. Lungs**.",

But thiazides rarely cause hypercalcemia as a result of this enhanced reabsorption, they can unmask hypercalcemia due to other causes.This effect on calcium makes them useful in the t/t of kidney stones caused by idiopathic hypercalciuria.Major indications of thiazide diuretics:-HypertensionHeart failureNephrolithiasis due to idiopathic hypercalciuriaNephrogenic diabetes insipidusAdverse effect of thiazide diuretics Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosisDue to the action of thiazides, more salts are delivered to the collecting tubule. Increased delivery leads to increased secretion of K+ and H+ by the duct causing hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.Impaired carbohydrate tolerance (Hyperglycemia)Hyperglycemia may occur in patients who are overtly diabetic or who have even mildly abnormal glucose tolerance tests.The effect is due to both impaired pancreatic release of insulin and diminished utilization of glucose. HyperlipidemiaThiazides cause a 5-15% increase in total serum cholesterol and low density lipoproteins (LDL) HyperuricemiaThiazides cause increased reabsorption of uric acid.HyponatremiaIt is due to combination of hypovolemia induced elevation of ADH, reduction in the diluting capacity of the kidney and increased thirst.Allergic reactionsThe thiazides are sulfonamides and they share cross-relativity with other members of this group. Photosensitivity or generalized dermatitis occurs rarely. Serious allergic reactions are extremely rare but do include hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute necrotizing pancreatitis.Other toxicitiesWeakness, fatigability and paresthesiasContraindications of thiazide diureticsHepatic cirrhosisBorderline renal failure",

Drugsthat inhibit renin have been available for many years but have been limited by low potency, poor bioavailability, and short duration of action. However, a new class of nonpeptide, low- molecularweight, orally active inhibitors has recently been developed. Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor recently approved for hypertension, is in clinical trials for heart failure. Preliminary results suggest an efficacy similar to that of ACE inhibitors. Aliskiren is contraindicated in pregnancy.INHIBITION OF RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEMSympatheticblockersPlasma renin activity is increased by reflex increase in sympathetic discharge.
